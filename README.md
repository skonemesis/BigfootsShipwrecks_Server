### **Description:**  

This addon spawns **shipwrecks with loot crates and markers** in random ocean locations on server restart.  
It does **NOT** spawn AI at the crates (yet), but AI can be manually added.  

**Key Gameplay Mechanics:**  
- Players **must transport crates to shore** using diving gear and transport vehicles.  
- **Inventory cannot be accessed underwater** due to Arma mechanics.  
- Compatible with **R3F Logistics, Igiload, and Exile crate mounting** for transport.  

Most settings can be configured in **config.sqf**.  

---

### **Features:**  
- **Configurable crate loot** (loot spawn percentages, guaranteed items, additional random items, poptab rewards).  
- **Dynamic wreck spawning** (random locations based on configurable center and distance parameters).  
- **Automatic marker system** (indicating wreck locations, disappearing when players are near).  
- **Configurable player notifications** (via chat and Exile toast messages).  
- **Logging system** (optional debug logs for crate contents and wreck spawns).  

---

### **Roadmap:**  
- Add optional **AI spawns** around crates.  
- Allow **shipwreck clustering** in specific regions (e.g., central bays, deep waters).  
- Introduce **rare loot mechanics** (increased chance for high-value items).
